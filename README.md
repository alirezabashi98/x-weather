## Description
The x weather program is a weather program for practicing clean code and after writing it, I decided to keep it updated. If you are a programmer, you can learn new things by reading the codes. If you see a problem, you can contact me to improve.
<br>
The weather program was written with the help of the api provided by (openweathermap.org)[openweathermap.org. <br>
There are four cities: Tehran, Dubai, London, New York by default, which you can delete by dragging or clicking the delete button, or you can add them by searching and selecting new provinces.
